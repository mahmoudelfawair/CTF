Our recon team has infiltrated Stark Industries and stole a mysterious program. Rumor has it, this program is a vital part of Tony Stark's new Iron Man suit. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to break into this program and retrieve the hidden key that breaks the schematics of the new suit.

Hail Hydra.
